The construction of the Garrison Chapel came about as a result of the confluence of a number of factors. During this period the British Imperial Government embarked on a programme of building a number of schools throughout the British Empire aimed at the education not only of the children of military and naval personnel but also for the instruction of soldiers and sailors themselves, who, at that time, were largely uneducated. Similar buildings were in fact built throughout the British Empire including the Indian sub-continent. In the mid-1850s Malta was already under British rule and its strategic position particularly as a naval base, had already been recognised. Around this time, Queen Adelaide, consort to King William IV and a very devout lady, during a visit to Malta, expressed her concern that the troops in Malta did not have a place of worship of their own and encouraged the building of a Church for this use. Indeed, while military and naval activity on the Island during that time was considerable, there was no multi-denominational or Anglican Church in Malta. Numerous military and naval personnel were stationed on the Island or passed through as the British navy and military crossed the Empire. The outbreak of the Crimean War in 1853 resulted in significantly more troop traffic through the Grand Harbour and its surrounding areas further increasing the number of troops and their families needing to be educated. Interestingly, therefore, the Garrison Chapel was planned and built to be used for a dual purpose. During the week it was used as a school, while on Sunday’s it was used as a multi-denominational place of worship.

The duration of the siege is unknown, but it probably lasted for some weeks or months.

According to Al-Himyarī, Malta remained almost uninhabited until it was resettled in around 1048 or 1049 by a Muslim community and their slaves, who rebuilt the city of Melite as Medina, making it 'a finer place than it was before'. However, archaeological evidence suggests that Melite/Medina was already a thriving Muslim settlement by the beginning of the 11th century, so Al-Himyarī's account might be unreliable. In 1053–54, the Byzantines besieged Medina but they were repelled by its defenders. Although their rule was relatively short, the Arabs left a significant impact on Malta. In addition to their language, Siculo-Arabic, cotton, oranges and lemons and many new techniques in irrigation were introduced.

While the group is primarily intentioned for single people, many couples have counted among its members over the years. The CSC holds its meetings every Tuesday at its Floriana premises. While many of the meetings are of a spiritual character, meetings are also held about subjects of general interest, like psychology, art, health, and personal development. The meetings are often animated by powerpoint presentations. Weekend activities vary, and include cultural visits, birthday parties, eating out, and attendance of concerts and performances.

Christianity is not only a religion to be practiced within certain spaces, but a way of life. This is something we incorporate at our school, both on a policy level but also on a personal level. A main pillar of Christianity is loving one another regardless of background, ability, race, or religion, which is why inclusion is a priority for us. We do our best to ensure there is equity in the processes by which students are accepted at our school. I make use of the word equity because each student has her own special needs and requirements, and we try to ensure we distribute our attention fairly and accordingly.

Father Diacono was happy to guide these pious women and immediately set up a more detailed programme of action for this group… Under the guidance of Father Diacono, the number of women increased considerably, and early in 1879, Father Diacono rented a house, at 54 Triq Ghajn Qatet for a modest fee so that the group could gather there. Meanwhile the meetings became more frequent and those responsible for the upkeep of the house went there every day. This house was named Casa di Carita’ – House of Charity, and it became the focal point of a host of spiritual and social gatherings, the former presided by Father Diacono, the latter presided by the members of the Twelve-starred Crown… At a time when the rights of women were practically unheard of, this energetic priest wanted to found a community where spirituality and labour would prevail… Fully conscious that poverty thrives on ignorance, he set up classes to impart basic education to the poor so that one day they could help themselves out of their own adversities. Secondly he organised lace-making lessons, thus greatly raising the standards of the product and hence increasing the income of lace-makers from its sale.

Armed with only an Amiga computer (8 bit sound, only 4 voice polyphonic and 1 megabyte of ram), an old 4 track, a cheap reverb box and a microphone, he set out to make these two intense areas of music converge into one style. And attempt to cope with the ratio of a ton of ideas to a very restricted audio setup. The earliest Apotheosis material was quite primitive. It hovered more along the ambient zone with textures and passages derived from the cryptic and cold realms of Black Metal.

This appointment is still held every year, on the eve of the festival at around 1.00 p.m. This was not the only appointment with the emigrants. In fact, every year several emigrants contact us, both through phone calls and even through email to convey their congratulations to their relatives who live in Gozo.
