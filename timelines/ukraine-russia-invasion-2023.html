The Ukrainian military said they shot down 15 Russian cruise missiles and 21 drones in and around the capital overnight, with two people injured by falling debris. Five private homes were also damage according to Ukrainian officials. Another missile attack later was reported later in the day, with the Ukrainian military saying that they had intercepted all 15 cruise missiles and 18 drones launched by Russian forces and about 30 other "hostile objects". Two people were killed and four others were injured by Russian bombing in Kivsharivka, Kharkiv Oblast, while the same numbers were reported in a Russian attack on a village in Zaporizhzhia Oblast.

A Russian sympathizer and mayoral candidate in Russian-organized local elections was killed by a car bomb in Mykhailivka.
<br>
<br>The Russian Defence Ministry announced the deployment of Chechen "Akhmat" special forces to the frontlines in Mariinka, Donetsk Oblast for an offensive.

He also accused the Russian military of laying mines targeting his personnel as they retreated.
<br>
<br>The governor of Russia's Bryansk Oblast claimed that Ukrainian forces shelled a village along the international border, destroying a house.

        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-0 display-4">Three people, including a mother and her child, were killed in a Russian air attack on Kyiv in the early hours of the day. The victims were from the Desnianskyi District. Reports said that the casualties were trying to access a locked bomb shelter when the attack occurred. Four people were detained in connection to the incident, namely a security guard, the director of a medical facility, his deputy and the first deputy of the district administration. A subsequent audit of Kyiv's bomb shelters found that nearly half of them were unfit for use or closed. Damage was also reported in the Dniprovskyi District. Ten Iskander missiles were intercepted according to the Ukrainian military.
<br>
<br>In Russia's Belgorod Oblast, eight people were reported to have been injured by Ukrainian shelling in Shebekino. The regional governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, claimed that Ukrainian forces used Grad rockets. Two others were injured in a drone attack in Belgorod city. The Russian defence ministry claimed it had repulsed three Ukrainian attacks on Belgorod, killed more than 50 Ukrainian soldiers and destroyed four armored vehicles. It said the attacks involved up to 70 "militants", five tanks, four armoured vehicles, seven pick-up trucks and a Kamaz truck.
<br>
<br>The Ukrainian Ministry of Infrastructure said the Black Sea Grain Initiative had been halted again because Russia had blocked the registration of ships to all Ukrainian ports.

<br>
<br>The FSB said it had discovered an "intelligence action" that had compromised the phones of Russians as well as diplomats from Israel, Syria, China and NATO members and claimed that Apple had worked with US intelligence agencies such as the National Security Agency in compromising numerous iPhones. Apple did not comment on whether its products in Russia had been hacked but denied working with authorities to compromise its devices.
<br>
<br>The Pentagon said that it would buy Elon Musk's Starlink satellite service for Ukraine to ensure the continued effectivity of communications in the country.
<br>
<br>The US State Department said it was revoking the visas of Russian nuclear inspectors, denying pending applications for new monitors and canceling standard clearances for Russian aircraft to enter US airspace in retaliation for Russia's suspension of its participation in the New START treaty. It also said it would no longer notify Russia of any updates on the status or location of "treaty-accountable items" like missiles and launchers.
<br>
<br>The Swiss National Council voted down, 98–75, a parliamentary initiative put forward by a committee that would have specifically authorized the transfer of Swiss-made arms to Ukraine. Its opponents claimed the proposal was a violation of the country's longstanding policy of neutrality.<br></p>

<br>
<br>The Russian defence ministry claimed its forces had pushed out Ukrainian forces from positions around Krasnohorivka and Yasynuvata in Donetsk Oblast.
<br>
<br>A fire broke out at the Afipsky oil refinery in Russia's Krasnodar Krai. Veniamin Kondratyev, Governor of the region, blamed the fire on a Ukrainian drone strike. The fire was put out with minimal damage and no casualties. Another drone was reported to have crashed into the Ilsky refinery. The governor of Belgorod Oblast announced the beginning of evacuations of children from areas affected by Ukrainian shelling, saying that 300 children would be taken to Voronezh, about 250 km (155 miles) away, while another 1,000 children would be evacuated to other regions over the coming days. He also said two border settlements were shelled by Ukraine, injuring four.

<br>
<br>Moscow was attacked by at least eight drones, causing minor damage to several buildings according to the Russian ministry of defence. Three lost control due to electronic warfare and the other five were shot down by a Pantsir-S system. The Mayor of Moscow Sergei Sobyanin said that "two people had sought medical assistance". Russia accused Ukraine of responsibility, which a Ukrainian official denied but said that the country was "pleased" over the attack. One person was killed and two others were injured after purported Ukrainian shelling of a centre for displaced people in Belgorod Oblast.
<br>
<br>The Russian Interior Ministry placed General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, commander of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of the Ukrainian Ground Forces, on its wanted list.

<br>
<br>South Africa's leading opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, launched a court application to ensure the South African government detained Vladimir Putin and hand him over to the International Criminal Court for war crimes in Ukraine should he "set foot in South Africa."

<br>
<br>The Pentagon announced that it had made an accounting error in relation to the aid supplied to Ukraine. The error was made when the Pentagon overestimated to Congress, by at least $3 billion, the cost of weapons sent to Ukraine. This error meant that these funds were effectively a surplus that could be spent on more weapons for Ukraine. President Biden said he would support a joint effort with allies to train Ukrainian pilots on fourth generation aircraft, including F-16s fighter jets. Shortly afterwards, Denmark said it would provide direct help in training. No date was announced for such training to commence. Once it does it could take six to nine months to properly train Ukrainian pilots and crews to use the F-16. A US official told CNN that the United States was prepared to help train Ukrainian pilots on the F-16. The training would take place in Europe in the "coming weeks", along with European allies, while a decision on the number of aircraft would be made at a later date.
<br>
<br>During the 49th G7 summit in Hiroshima, Japan, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced that the government was introducing new sanctions against Russian exports, particularly on diamonds, nickel, copper and aluminum. He also said that the government would also target 86 more people and companies connected to President Putin, including people who were "actively undermining the impact of existing sanctions". Sunak said that the new sanctions were made to ensure Russia paid "a price for its illegal activity" and urged other G7 countries to follow suit. The United States also announced that it would tighten export controls to Russia, particularly with regards to militarily important goods, and impose nearly 300 new sanctions against targets linked to Russia. Canada also imposed sanctions on targets linked to the Russian military, relatives of listed persons, members of the Kremlin elite, and those involved in human rights violations.
<br>
<br>In response to these sanctions, the Russian Foreign Ministry announced a ban on entry into the country on 500 Americans including former President Barack Obama, comedians Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel and Seth Meyers, Senators J. D. Vance, Katie Britt and Eric Schmitt, former US Ambassador Jon Huntsman Jr., presumptive Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Charles Q. Brown Jr. and several journalists of CNN. Also included were officials involved in the prosecution of participants in the United States Capitol attack in 2021. It also continued to deny US consular access to detained journalist Evan Gershkovich in retaliation for the blocking of entry to Russian journalists during Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's visit to the UN in New York in April 2023. In conjunction, the Russian Interior Ministry issued an arrest warrant for the International Criminal Court's Prosecutor Karim Ahmad Khan, who was responsible for issuing Putin's arrest warrant in March 2023, while the Prosecutor-General of Russia deemed the environmental organization Greenpeace an "undesirable organization", calling it "a threat to the foundations of the constitutional order and security" of the country for interfering in the "internal affairs of the state" and spreading "anti-Russian propaganda" and calling for economic sanctions. The order prompted Greenpeace to halt its operations in Russia.

These individuals took videos of Ukrainian air defences in action then posted them on social media sites such as YouTube. Such information, the SBU alleged, could be used to make Russian strikes more accurate. The penalty for such a charge was five to eight years imprisonment.
<br>
<br>Russia's defence ministry claimed its forces had destroyed a British-made L-119 howitzer in Ukraine according to a report by state news agency TASS. It also claimed to have struck an ammunition depot in Mykolaiv.

        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-0 display-4">Kyiv came under air attack in the early hours of the morning. Vitali Klitschko, Kyiv's Mayor, said that debris from intercepted missiles struck the city zoo in the Solomianskyi District and the Shevchenkivskyi District, as well as several cars, and wounded three people. According to Kyiv's military administrator, Serhiy Popko, the attack was "exceptional", as it involved "the maximum number of attack missiles in the shortest period of time." Ukraine stated all eighteen missiles were shot down, including six Kh-47M2 Kinzhal missiles. The attacks came from the north, south and east while being launched from air, land and sea, according to Ukrainian military commander Valerii Zaluzhny. However, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu dismissed the Ukrainian claims, saying that they had launched a lesser amount of missiles. The Russian Ministry of Defence claimed to have destroyed a US-built Patriot surface-to-air missile defense system with a Kinzhal missile. A US official later told CNN that a Patriot system was likely damaged but not destroyed during the attack, and that assessments for potential damage were ongoing. According to a US official the Patriot system could be repaired in Ukraine. Due to modular nature of the system it may just require the replacement of a damaged component with a new one.
<br>
<br>Denis Pushilin, head of the Russian-backed Donetsk People's Republic, said that Russian forces had seized several Ukrainian positions near Avdiivka. The Ukrainian Defence Ministry said that its forces had retaken about 20sq km (7.5sq miles) of territory from Russian forces in the north and south of the outskirts of Bakhmut in recent days while acknowledging continued Russian advances inside the city.

<br>Hungary blocked the disbursement of an upcoming tranche of military support for Ukraine provided under the European Union's European Peace Facility (EPF), arguing that the fund was too focused on Ukraine and that the funds could be used elsewhere. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto previously said that the country would block the disbursement as well as any new sanctions package on Russia until Ukraine removed OTP Bank, Hungary's largest commercial bank, in the list of sponsors of the war in Ukraine due to the position of the bank's management to continue operations in Russia and its client republics in the Donbas, which itself was based on a decision by the National Agency for the Prevention of Corruption of Ukraine. Hungary also demanded the removal of three people from a new sanctions list proposed by the European Commission as part of the 11th package of sanctions against Russia.

Nine personnel were said to have been killed. The Russian newspaper Kommersant reported that the aircraft were on their way for a bombing run in neighboring Chernihiv Oblast when they were shot down by Ukrainian forces, which was also echoed by Russian pro-military bloggers. The Russian state news agency TASS only reported the loss of an Su-34 warplane without providing a reason, as well as that of a helicopter due to an engine fire near Klintsy, about 40 km (25 miles) from the international border.

The claim was also shared by Russian military bloggers but denied by the Russian Defence Ministry, which said that Russian forces repelled a surge of Ukrainian attacks in Soledar and that its forces had fallen back to "more favourable positions" near the Berkhivka reservoir northwest of Bakhmut for tactical reasons.

<br>The United Kingdom Secretary for Defence Ben Wallace announced that the UK supplied Ukraine with Storm Shadow missiles. With a range of 250 kilometres, the missiles are capable of hitting targets in Crimea from the positions currently held by Ukraine. The United States supported the UK's decision. Secretary Wallace explained that these missiles were sent to Ukraine "to mitigate a situation where we (the UK) can't provide combat fighters."
<br>
<br>The US ambassador to South Africa Reuben Brigety accused the country of supplying weapons to Russia despite its professed neutrality in the war in Ukraine, claiming that the Russian ship Lady R was loaded with ammunition and arms at Naval Base Simon's Town in Cape Town on 6–8 December 2022. The office of President Cyril Ramaphosa expressed disappointment over the claims and said no evidence had been provided to support them. An independent inquiry later confirmed Ramaphos's claims, while the South African Foreign Ministry said Brigety "apologized unreservedly" for his remarks.

<br>A Russian court convicted 60-year old Saint Petersburg pensioner Irina Tsybaneva for desecrating the graves of President Vladimir Putin's parents at Serafimovskoe Cemetery. Tsybaneva, who was given a two-year suspended sentence, left a note at the Putin family plot referring to him as a "maniac", a "murderer" and a "monster" after claiming to have been "overwhelmed by fear" following news of the conflict in Ukraine. A military court sentenced history teacher Nikita Tushkanov of Komi Republic to five and a half years in prison for justifying "terrorism" and "discrediting" the Russian army after calling the Crimean Bridge explosion a "birthday present" for Putin in a social media post in October 2022.<br></p>

        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-0 display-4">Ukroboronprom, with the help of a "NATO country", started manufacturing 125 mm smoothbore ammunition for Ukraine's Soviet-era tanks. Also being manufactured were 120 mm mortar rounds, 122 mm and 152 mm artillery shells. The production of projectiles is completely dispersed over a large number of cities. This is part of a larger effort by Ukraine to manufacture ammunition as Western donors have reached into their own stockpiles.

<br>Sébastien Lecornu, Minister of Armed Forces for France, announced that AMX-10 RC armored fighting vehicles have arrived in Ukraine.</p>
