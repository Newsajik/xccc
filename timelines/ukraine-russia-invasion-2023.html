<br>
<br>Fighting broke out in Kherson Oblast, as the Institute for the Study of War assessed that 70 Ukrainian soldiers had landed under the Russian-controlled end of the Antonivskyi Bridge on the left bank of the Dnipro river, in the first incident of its kind since the alteration of the river's course in the area following the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam in June. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Defence Ministry said its forces were advancing towards Berdyansk and Melitopol in the Zaporizhzhia front, but acknowledged Russian advances in Lyman, Avdiivka and Marinka in the Donetsk front. Russia also launched an offensive around Svatove, Luhansk Oblast, attacking the towns of Bilohorivka and Serebryanka.

<br>The Wagner Group suspended the operations of its physical recruitment centers for a month, while keeping its call centers open for applications. Poland announced it was sending 500 police and counterterrorist forces to reinforce its border with Belarus following the Wagner Group's redeployment there and to prevent migrants from illegally crossing the border.<br></p>

        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-0 display-4"><strong>Wagner rebellion<br></strong><br>Wagner Group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin claimed in an audio message that he had "25,000" fighters at his disposal, including soldiers who defected from the Russian army. Prosecutor General Igor Krasnov opened a criminal case against Prigozhin for "armed rebellion". The M4 highway between Lipetsk Oblast and Voronezh Oblasts was closed after the governor of Lipetsk, Igor Artamonov, claimed that a convoy of military vehicles had used the highway earlier. Prigozhin appeared to have seized the headquarters of the Southern Military District in Rostov-on-Don. Wagner also claimed control of military installations in Voronezh, where a fuel depot caught fire following alleged sightings of a military helicopter. Clashes between Wagner and the Russian military were reported in the region. Later in the day, they reached Lipetsk Oblast, with some analysts pinpointing sightings near Yelets, 390 kilometres (240 miles) south of Moscow.
<br>
<br>In Moscow, according to TASS, security was increased at key facilities. The Institute for the Study of War considered Prigozhin efforts as "unlikely to succeed" due to a lack of support from General Sergey Surovikin, the former overall commander of Russian forces in Ukraine, who called Putin "the popularly elected President of the Russian Federation".
<br>
<br>In his first comments on the mutiny, President Vladimir Putin said "those who carry deliberately on a path of treason, preparing an armed rebellion when you were preparing terrorist attacks, will be punished," but did not directly mention Prigozhin.
<br>
<br>Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov offered his forces to help "preserve Russia's units and defend its statehood", calling Prigozhin's actions "a knife in the back".
<br>
<br>The FSB raided the headquarters of PMC Wagner in Saint Petersburg and reportedly seized cardboard boxes containing 4 billion rubles ($47 million) from vehicles near the office. Prigozhin said that the money was meant to pay employee salaries and other company expenses.
<br>
<br>Later in the day, Prigozhin announced that his forces would stop their march on Moscow and withdraw to military camps following talks with Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko, by which time Prigozhin claimed to have been just 200 kilometers (120 miles) away from Moscow. In exchange, Prigozhin was to be allowed to go into exile in Belarus and all charges against him and his followers were to be dropped. At around 11:00 p.m. (GMT+3), the Wagner Group began withdrawing their forces from Rostov-on-Don.<br></p>

        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-0 display-4">Several newspapers and analysts reported that Ukraine's counteroffensive had begun, with the Institute for the Study of War noting that activity throughout Ukraine was consistent with a variety of indicators that counteroffensive operations were underway across the theater.
<br>
<br>In the early hours of the counteroffensive, the Armed Forces of Ukraine suffered "significant losses" according to US officials and the Russian Ministry of Defence, but seemingly managed to break some lines of defence in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. According to US officials, the losses were not expected to impact Ukraine's counteroffensive as a whole. The Russian Defence Ministry said its forces had repelled an offensive by Ukrainian forces involving 1,500 soldiers and 150 armoured vehicles after a two-hour battle with Ukrainian troops in the early hours. In response, Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said only that Russia was conducting "defensive actions" near Orikhiv.
<br>
<br>Three people, including a child were reported to have been killed by Russian shelling in Ukrainsk, Donetsk Oblast. One person was killed and eight others were wounded after Russian shelling struck a flood evacuation point in Kherson.
<br>
<br>In Russia, drones struck two settlements in Belgorod Oblast.
<br>
<br>The Russian Orthodox Church transferred 11 Ukrainian POWs from Zakarpattia Oblast to Hungary, saying that it was a request by the Hungarian government. But despite assurances by the office of Prime Minister Viktor Orban that the prisoners arrived of their own volition and were free to leave the country, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said the Hungarians ignored their requests to contact them, adding that the transfer was conducted without the agreement of the Ukrainian government. On 20 June, three of the POWs were returned to Ukraine.
<br>
<br>The United Kingdom imposed new sanctions on Belarus for its support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which included banning imports of gold, cement, wood and rubber from Belarus and blocking exports to Belarus of banknotes and machinery, as well as materials that could be used to produce chemical and biological weapons.
<br>
<br>As part of NATO's efforts to secure its border with Ukraine, Germany announced it would donate two MANTIS Air Defence Systems to Slovakia.<br></p>

        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-0 display-4"><strong>Destruction of the Kakhovka Dam</strong><br><strong><br></strong>Ukraine said Russian forces had blown up the Kakhovka Dam along the Dnipro River in Kherson Oblast, releasing a large amount of water, while the Russian-installed mayor of Nova Kakhovka blamed the destruction on Ukrainian shelling but said only the upper part of the structure was damaged. An assessment by Ukraine's state hydropower agency, Ukrhydroenergo, determined that the dam was "totally destroyed" after a blast from inside the engine room and could not be restored, while Ukrainian officials claimed Russia destroyed the dam "in a panic" to slow down its upcoming offensive.
<br>
<br>The Ukrainian government issued an evacuation order for ten villages downstream from the dam as well as parts of Kherson city. The governor of Kherson Oblast, Oleksandr Prokudin, told Ukrainian TV that eight villages had been flooded, and that evacuations by bus and train were ongoing for 16,000 residents in affected areas. The Ukrainian Interior Ministry later said 24 villages had been flooded, while President Zelenskyy said up to 80 villages were at risk of flooding. Around 40,000 people were in need of evacuation - 17,000 people in the Ukrainian-controlled right bank of the Dnipro and 25,000 on the Russian-controlled left bank, with Ukraine saying it had evacuated 1,000 people. 150 tonnes of engine oil were reported to have spilled into the Dnipro after the collapse. One person was killed and two Ukrainian policemen were wounded by Russian shelling in the area.
<br>
<br>In Nova Kakhovka, 900 people were evacuated, 600 houses were reported to have been flooded and a state of emergency was declared by Russian authorities as water levels rose to over 11 meters (36 feet). The city's Kazkova Dibrova zoo lost all its 300 animals in the floods, while the town of Oleshky was reported to have been heavily flooded. Seven people were reported missing in Nova Kakhovka, while about 100 residents were reported to have been trapped. Thousands of animals were reported to have been killed in the Nizhnedniprovsky National Nature Park. At least eight people were reported to have died due to the resulting floods, while about 600 square kilometres (230 square miles) of the region was underwater, 68 percent of which was on the Russian-controlled side. Over the following days, the death toll rose to a total of 58.<br></p>

        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-0 display-4">President Zelenskyy appeared to confirm the fall of Bakhmut to Russia, saying in an interview to AFP that "For today, Bakhmut is only in our hearts" and that "nothing" was left of the city. However, he and his office later clarified that he had not said that the city had fallen. The Ukrainian Defence Ministry said its forces were holding on to a sector of the city while partly encircling Bakhmut itself.
<br>
<br>A Russian-installed official in occupied Zaporizhzhia Oblast said that the Ukrainian military had attacked the port of Berdiansk with seven missiles, including four British-supplied Storm Shadows.

The Ukrainian Air Force also claimed to have destroyed two drones in the country's "east" and one in the "south" without further details.
<br>
<br>Yevgeny Prigozhin claimed on Telegram that his Wagner mercenaries had completely captured Bakhmut. This was denied by Ukraine, which nevertheless called the situation in the city "critical".

<br>
<br>The Pentagon announced that it had made an accounting error in relation to the aid supplied to Ukraine. The error was made when the Pentagon overestimated to Congress, by at least $3 billion, the cost of weapons sent to Ukraine. This error meant that these funds were effectively a surplus that could be spent on more weapons for Ukraine. President Biden said he would support a joint effort with allies to train Ukrainian pilots on fourth generation aircraft, including F-16s fighter jets. Shortly afterwards, Denmark said it would provide direct help in training. No date was announced for such training to commence. Once it does it could take six to nine months to properly train Ukrainian pilots and crews to use the F-16. A US official told CNN that the United States was prepared to help train Ukrainian pilots on the F-16. The training would take place in Europe in the "coming weeks", along with European allies, while a decision on the number of aircraft would be made at a later date.
<br>
<br>During the 49th G7 summit in Hiroshima, Japan, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced that the government was introducing new sanctions against Russian exports, particularly on diamonds, nickel, copper and aluminum. He also said that the government would also target 86 more people and companies connected to President Putin, including people who were "actively undermining the impact of existing sanctions". Sunak said that the new sanctions were made to ensure Russia paid "a price for its illegal activity" and urged other G7 countries to follow suit. The United States also announced that it would tighten export controls to Russia, particularly with regards to militarily important goods, and impose nearly 300 new sanctions against targets linked to Russia. Canada also imposed sanctions on targets linked to the Russian military, relatives of listed persons, members of the Kremlin elite, and those involved in human rights violations.
<br>
<br>In response to these sanctions, the Russian Foreign Ministry announced a ban on entry into the country on 500 Americans including former President Barack Obama, comedians Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel and Seth Meyers, Senators J. D. Vance, Katie Britt and Eric Schmitt, former US Ambassador Jon Huntsman Jr., presumptive Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Charles Q. Brown Jr. and several journalists of CNN. Also included were officials involved in the prosecution of participants in the United States Capitol attack in 2021. It also continued to deny US consular access to detained journalist Evan Gershkovich in retaliation for the blocking of entry to Russian journalists during Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's visit to the UN in New York in April 2023. In conjunction, the Russian Interior Ministry issued an arrest warrant for the International Criminal Court's Prosecutor Karim Ahmad Khan, who was responsible for issuing Putin's arrest warrant in March 2023, while the Prosecutor-General of Russia deemed the environmental organization Greenpeace an "undesirable organization", calling it "a threat to the foundations of the constitutional order and security" of the country for interfering in the "internal affairs of the state" and spreading "anti-Russian propaganda" and calling for economic sanctions. The order prompted Greenpeace to halt its operations in Russia.

These individuals took videos of Ukrainian air defences in action then posted them on social media sites such as YouTube. Such information, the SBU alleged, could be used to make Russian strikes more accurate. The penalty for such a charge was five to eight years imprisonment.
<br>
<br>Russia's defence ministry claimed its forces had destroyed a British-made L-119 howitzer in Ukraine according to a report by state news agency TASS. It also claimed to have struck an ammunition depot in Mykolaiv.

Vitali Klitschko, Kyiv's Mayor, said that debris from intercepted missiles struck the city zoo in the Solomianskyi District and the Shevchenkivskyi District, as well as several cars, and wounded three people. According to Kyiv's military administrator, Serhiy Popko, the attack was "exceptional", as it involved "the maximum number of attack missiles in the shortest period of time." Ukraine stated all eighteen missiles were shot down, including six Kh-47M2 Kinzhal missiles. The attacks came from the north, south and east while being launched from air, land and sea, according to Ukrainian military commander Valerii Zaluzhny. However, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu dismissed the Ukrainian claims, saying that they had launched a lesser amount of missiles. The Russian Ministry of Defence claimed to have destroyed a US-built Patriot surface-to-air missile defense system with a Kinzhal missile. A US official later told CNN that a Patriot system was likely damaged but not destroyed during the attack, and that assessments for potential damage were ongoing. According to a US official the Patriot system could be repaired in Ukraine. Due to modular nature of the system it may just require the replacement of a damaged component with a new one.
<br>
<br>Denis Pushilin, head of the Russian-backed Donetsk People's Republic, said that Russian forces had seized several Ukrainian positions near Avdiivka. The Ukrainian Defence Ministry said that its forces had retaken about 20sq km (7.5sq miles) of territory from Russian forces in the north and south of the outskirts of Bakhmut in recent days while acknowledging continued Russian advances inside the city.

Robert Shonov, who worked in the US consulate in Vladivostok before being subcontracted to summarize Russian media reports for the embassy in Moscow was arrested, charged with cooperating "on a confidential basis with a foreign state, [or] international or foreign organisation", and detained at Lefortovo Prison. The State Department said the allegations were without merit.

<br>Hungary blocked the disbursement of an upcoming tranche of military support for Ukraine provided under the European Union's European Peace Facility (EPF), arguing that the fund was too focused on Ukraine and that the funds could be used elsewhere. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto previously said that the country would block the disbursement as well as any new sanctions package on Russia until Ukraine removed OTP Bank, Hungary's largest commercial bank, in the list of sponsors of the war in Ukraine due to the position of the bank's management to continue operations in Russia and its client republics in the Donbas, which itself was based on a decision by the National Agency for the Prevention of Corruption of Ukraine. Hungary also demanded the removal of three people from a new sanctions list proposed by the European Commission as part of the 11th package of sanctions against Russia.

This prompted them to close their performance with a message for solidarity with Ukraine. 11 people were also injured in overnight drone attacks in Khmelnytskyi. The Ukrainian military said that 18 out of 22 Iranian Shahed-131/136 drones were shot down in the attacks. Russia accused Ukraine of attacking the occupied city of Luhansk with its newly acquired British Storm Shadow missiles, wounding six children.

<br>
<br>Two Russian helicopters, both Mi-8s, and two Russian fighters, an Su-34 and an Su-35, crashed in Bryansk Oblast, near the border with Ukraine with no survivors. Nine personnel were said to have been killed. The Russian newspaper Kommersant reported that the aircraft were on their way for a bombing run in neighboring Chernihiv Oblast when they were shot down by Ukrainian forces, which was also echoed by Russian pro-military bloggers. The Russian state news agency TASS only reported the loss of an Su-34 warplane without providing a reason, as well as that of a helicopter due to an engine fire near Klintsy, about 40 km (25 miles) from the international border. Ukrainian officials also said that the aircraft were on their way to a bombing run but blamed their downing on unidentified actors. The Kyiv Independent reported that Russian authorities were searching for "saboteurs" in connection with the crashes.
<br>
<br>Ahead of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to Germany, Federal Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said that the country would provide Ukraine a military aid package worth 2.7bn euros ($2.95bn).

Geolocated footage showed Ukrainian troops counterattacking near Khromove and Bila Hora, which Russian forces were trying to seize in order to encircle the city. Ukrainian sources said their forces advanced 2.6 km (1.6 miles) along a 3 km-wide (1.9-mile) front, destroying the 6th and 8th companies of the Russian 72nd Separate Motor Rifle Brigade; the head of the Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said already on 9 May that Russian troops had abandoned some positions on his flank in Bakhmut. The claim was also shared by Russian military bloggers but denied by the Russian Defence Ministry, which said that Russian forces repelled a surge of Ukrainian attacks in Soledar and that its forces had fallen back to "more favourable positions" near the Berkhivka reservoir northwest of Bakhmut for tactical reasons.

The office of President Cyril Ramaphosa expressed disappointment over the claims and said no evidence had been provided to support them. An independent inquiry later confirmed Ramaphos's claims, while the South African Foreign Ministry said Brigety "apologized unreservedly" for his remarks.

Later in March, the Hungarian Prime Minister's chief of staff, Gergely Gulyás, said that Hungary would not arrest Putin if he entered the country, stating that the warrant was inconsistent with Hungarian law.</p>

        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-0 display-4">Ukroboronprom, with the help of a "NATO country", started manufacturing 125 mm smoothbore ammunition for Ukraine's Soviet-era tanks. Also being manufactured were 120 mm mortar rounds, 122 mm and 152 mm artillery shells. The production of projectiles is completely dispersed over a large number of cities. This is part of a larger effort by Ukraine to manufacture ammunition as Western donors have reached into their own stockpiles.
