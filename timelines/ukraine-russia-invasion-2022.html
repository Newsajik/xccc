Ukraine claimed the hotel was being used as a barracks and it had killed 200 paratroopers. There was no independent confirmation of Ukrainian claims. Pro-Russian Telegram channels said the hotel was "choke-full".
<br>
<br>Latvia, in response to the invasion of Ukraine, destroyed the controversial 80-meter high Soviet-era Monument to the Liberators of Soviet Latvia and Riga from the German Fascist Invaders in Victory Park. The Polish government claimed that Belarus destroyed a monument to the Polish Home Army that were killed during World War 2, which also included a graveyard. Poland also announced that it was going to demolish a monument to Soviet soldiers in the southwest of the country.
<br>
<br>Germany's counterintelligence service believed that there were active Russian spies in the country monitoring the training of Ukrainian soldiers on Western artillery systems by US and German trainers. The spies were believed to be using both vehicles and drones.
<br>
<br>The Ukrainian government distributed iodine tablets to residents living near the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. Two of the six reactors were reconnected to the grid after being disconnected earlier following "fire damage to a transmission line" on 25 August. Satellite photos indicated smoke rising from the plant over the last several days.<br></p>

<br>
<br>Research conducted by the Yale University's School of Public Health's Humanitarian Research Lab and the Conflict Observatory located some 21 filtration camps in Russian-occupied Donetsk Oblast run by Russian and Russian-allied forces and housing Ukrainian "civilians, POWs, and other personnel" for four main purposes: "1) registration points, 2) camps and other holding facilities for those awaiting registration, 3) interrogation centers, and 4) correctional colonies". Satellite pictures of the camps also indicated disturbed earth, which researchers said was consistent with mass graves. Kaveh Khoshnood, a professor at the Yale's School of Public Health's, said: "Incommunicado detention of civilians is more than a violation of international humanitarian law — it represents a threat to the public health of those currently in the custody of Russia and its proxies. The conditions of confinement documented in this report allegedly include insufficient sanitation, shortages of food and water, cramped conditions, and reported acts consistent with torture."<br></p>

This echoes earlier calls by Ukraine and supported by the United States. Russia refused such calls saying that it was protecting the plant from "terrorist attacks"; however, it invited officials from the IAEA to visit. Two of the workers at the plant told the BBC, via text message, that the staff were hostages and that shelling had prevented them from doing their normal work.
<br>
<br>An article published by the Kyiv Independent identified several deficiencies in Ukrainian artillery, including a "lack of effective top-level organization" and skills in counter-battery fire, as well as the near depletion of the former Soviet 152 mm ammunition during the late spring and the requisite switchover of Ukrainian artillery to the NATO-standard 155 mm ammunition in June. The reporting also described the benefits of using newer Western-supplied systems, including longer range and higher accuracy artillery systems that, over a period of weeks, resulted in the destruction of Russian command and control centers as well as "more than 50 fuel and munition dumps", which complicated artillery logistics and reduced Russian artillery fire rates in the Donbas by one-half to two-thirds.<br></p>

<br>
<br>Mikhail Mizintsev, chief of Russia's national defence control centre, said during a briefing that over the last 24 hours, "28,424 people, including 5,148 children" had been evacuated from the Donbas and other parts of Ukraine to Russia. In total since Feb 24, some "2,612,747 people, of which 412,553 are children" had been evacuated to Russia. Ukrainian authorities were not involved in these evacuations, and both US and Ukrainian officials regarded them as forcible deportations.<br></p>

<br>Russia started a "volunteer mobilisation": by the end of the month, 85 federal areas, including Crimea and Sevastopol, were expected to recruit 400 men each. Those signing a six month contract were to receive "3,750 to 6,000 US dollars per month". Some regions also offered a bonus of US $3,400. The Wagner Group also started recruiting prisoners.

<br>President Putin signed into force a number of laws including the recently announced "special economic measures", including forcing private companies to take government contracts, allowing the government to "temporarily reactivate mobilization capacities and facilities" while "unlocking state reserve material assets", and unilaterally change the work conditions of employees, such as increased operating hours.<br></p>

We have heard many times that the West wants to fight us to the last Ukrainian. This is a tragedy for the Ukrainian people, but it seems that everything is heading towards this. Everyone should know that, by and large, we haven't started anything yet in earnest. At the same time, we don't reject peace talks. But those who reject them should know that the further it goes, the harder it will be for them to negotiate with us." Mykhailo Podolyak, the Ukrainian chief negotiator, wrote on Twitter in response: "There is no 'collective West' plan. Only a specific z-army which entered sovereign Ukraine, shelling cities and killing civilians. Everything else is a primitive propaganda. That's why Mr. Putin's mantra of the 'war to the last Ukrainian' is yet another proof of deliberate Russian genocide."<br></p>

<br>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visited Kyiv and promised sanctions against Russia over its invasion, banning imports of Russian gold, and imposing sanctions and travel bans on 16 senior politicians and oligarchs. Military assistance would include 14 M113 APCs, 20 more Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicles, and other military equipment. This would bring the total to 88 vehicles given to Ukraine by Australia: 60 Bushmasters and 28 M113 APCs.<br></p>

He also commented on the supplies of M270 MLRS and M142 HIMARS, saying, "We understand that this supply [of advance rocket systems] from the United States and some other countries is meant to make up for the losses of this military equipment. This is nothing new. It doesn't change anything in essence." Putin further stated that Russia was finding Ukrainian weapons and "cracking them like nuts".
