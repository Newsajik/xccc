        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-0 display-4">President Putin revealed that he was considering adopting the concept of the "preemptive strike" from the U.S. According to him, the U.S. openly discussed this policy some years ago, but currently Russia was only just thinking about it. A few hours after Putin's statement, Jens Stoltenberg, general secretary of NATO, warned that there was a real possibility of a major war between Russia and NATO.
<br>
<br>Russia re-occupied the previously liberated Dnipro river island of Ostriv Velykyi Potomkin close to Kherson. This was confirmed by presidential advisor Oleksii Arestovych and Lieutenant Colonel Konstiantyn Mashovets, as well as some unofficial Russian sources. The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces claimed on 15 December that Russia had begun the process of forcibly deporting the island's civilian residents.</p>

        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-0 display-4">Explosions were reported at two Russian airbases: the one at Engels-2 reportedly damaged two Tu-95s; the other at the Dyagilevo military airbase near Ryazan, destroyed a fuel truck and killed three, injuring five. The Russian Ministry of Defence stated Ukraine attempted to strike Russia's long-range aviation bombers with Soviet-made jet drones, and that the drones were subsequently shot down at low altitude when approaching the air bases. The attack involved the use of Tu-141 drones that were taken out of storage and appeared to have been fitted with improvised explosives. While no significant damage or burn marks were visible on satellite images of Engels-2, at least one Tu-22M3 bomber was visually confirmed to be slightly damaged at Dyagilevo.
<br>
<br>Following the attacks, Russia launched a renewed wave of missile strikes against Ukraine, consisting of about 70 cruise missiles. Ukraine claimed 60 missiles were shot down, Russia claimed 17 targets were hit on the ground. As a result, a missile fell into the territory of Moldova, near the city of Briceni.</p>

        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-0 display-4">Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, suggested the creation of a UN court to investigate war crimes committed by Russia. Russia does not recognize the International Criminal Court, so the European Commission proposed two possible alternative ways to hold Russia accountable: either to create a court that would be set up by international treaties, or to create an international court with a number of judges from several countries. She estimated the war damage to Ukraine is about 600 billion Euros. She proposed a financial plan to help pay for this. She pointed out that the EU had frozen 300 billion Euros worth of Russian central bank reserves and 20 billion Euros worth of money belonging to Russian oligarchs, which she suggested should be invested. The investments could be given to Ukraine when sanctions are lifted. The original statement by Ursula von der Leyen included a claim that 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers and 20,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed so far in the war. This angered Ukrainian military officials, who said that the death toll was classified information. In response, the European Commission edited the video of von der Leyen's speech to remove this information. Official publications of the text of the speech were also edited to omit the numbers.</p>

He also promised Ukraine that NATO would one day accept them as a member and that Putin cannot deny sovereign nations the right to make their own sovereign decisions that were not a threat to Russia. He also speculated that the main challenges to Putin were democracy and freedom.</p>

        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-0 display-4">The European Parliament declared Russia a "state sponsor of terrorism" for the way it had systematically attacked civilians and committed war crimes. This declaration was symbolic, but called for more sanctions.
<br>
<br>The Russian military launched 65 to 70 missiles at civilian settlements and energy infrastructure, although 51 of those were said to have been shot down. The attack caused blackouts over much of Ukraine and forced several nuclear power plants to shut down. Much of Moldova also experienced blackouts due to the power grid failure in Ukraine.</p>

        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-0 display-4">After the missile strikes, more than 10 million people were without power by 17 November, but a day later Ukrainian officials reported that electricity had already been restored to "nearly 100%" of Ukraine.
<br>
<br>According to Ukrainian officials, one of the wrecks of missiles found after a missile attack earlier that day was that of an "X-55/Kh-55" cruise missile. These missiles were apparently incapable of carrying a conventional warhead, but this specific missile had an "imitation block" (model for training) of a nuclear bomb. They believed the missile was meant to help overwhelm Ukraine's missile defenses.</p>

        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-0 display-4">Russia launched about 85 to 100 missiles at a number of Ukrainian cities. The strategic bombing campaign caused severe shortages of electricity and water at multiple cities. According to the Ukrainian Air Force some 77 of 96 Russian missiles were shot down. A Pentagon official claimed the Russian plan was to exhaust the Ukrainian air defences. At one stage some 50 missiles were in combat "within minutes" near the Polish border.
<br>
<br>A missile crossed over the Ukrainian-Polish border and struck the village of Przewodów, killing two civilians. Top leaders in Poland held an emergency meeting. Initial assessments by the United States found that the missile was likely to have been an air defence missile fired by Ukrainian forces at an incoming Russian missile.
<br>
<br>According to Ukraine's Operational Command South, Ukrainian rocket and artillery units attacked Russian positions on the left bank of the Dnipro River and in the area of the Kinburn Spit.</p>

<br>
<br>The Armed Forces of Ukraine retook the village of Kupiansk-Vuzlovyi in Kharkiv Oblast. As of 27 September, up to 6% of the oblast's territory remained under occupation.
<br>
<br>The results of the referendums in the Russian-occupied territories were announced, all of which were in favor of annexation into Russia, with Donetsk Oblast 99.23% in favour, Luhansk Oblast 98.42% in favour, Kherson Oblast 87.05%, and Zaporizhzhia Oblast at 93.11%. There were planned votes in the Mykolaiv and Kharkiv oblasts that never materialized, mainly owing to limited control of territory. As a side effect of these referendums, Russia now claimed that the "very existence of the state is at risk", since much of the war was happening on what it now illegally considered Russian territory, and could be used as justification of using nuclear weapons.
<br>
<br>Over 194,000 Russian citizens, primarily fighting age men and their families, left Russia in what has been called a "mass exodus" after the announcement of a draft of 300,000 citizens to fight in the war. Many have gone to Kazakhstan, Serbia, Georgia, and Finland.</p>

Although Putin's address stated only reservists will be called up, with a focus on reservists with military experience, the official decree allowed for any citizen to be conscripted with exceptions for only age, sickness, and imprisonment status; it was reported that anti-war protesters who had been arrested were being conscripted. Furthermore, militants in the Luhansk and Donetsk People's Republics were to be considered soldiers of the Russian Federation going forward, and the LPR and DPR military units will be reordered according to Russian standards. Defence minister Sergei Shoigu said that 300,000 reservists will be mobilized. Putin also raised the threat of a nuclear response, saying "Russia will use all the instruments at its disposal to counter a threat against its territorial integrity—this is not a bluff".
<br>
<br>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Saudi Arabia reported that Russia released ten foreign prisoners of war after mediation by Prince Mohammed bin Salman. According to Robert Jenrick, the junior health minister of Britain, Aiden Aslin is among the prisoners released. Viktor Medvedchuk was reportedly freed as part of the deal.

<br>A record 215 Ukrainian soldiers, including fighters who led the defence of the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol, were released in a prisoner exchange with Russia after mediation by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Zelenskyy announced that, as part of the agreement, five of the freed captives would remain in Turkey in secure but comfortable conditions until the war is over.</p>

<br>Ukraine was searching the UK for foundries to make 155 mm ammunition due to Western stockpiles running low. BAE systems can increase production however Ukrainian officials are looking for other manufacturers. The US had sent "806,000" of these rounds to Ukraine and replacing them could take as long as "18 months".<br></p>
