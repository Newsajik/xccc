There is no point in staying in positions which have been destroyed over several months just for the sake of staying". The head of the Hirske Community Oleksiy Babchenko announced that the whole city is under Russian control. The Russian Ministry of Defence said that they have encircled 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers in the Zolote/Hirske cauldron.<br></p>

This is nothing new. It doesn't change anything in essence." Putin further stated that Russia was finding Ukrainian weapons and "cracking them like nuts".
