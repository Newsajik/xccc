He also added that there was no immediate information about possible casualties. However, neither of these incidents could immediately be verified.
<br>
<br>The Kyiv offensive fell apart several days after Russia said it would withdraw some troops from the north. The Russians retreated all the way back to Chernobyl. Ukraine's deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, later confirmed that Ukrainian forces had retaken control of all of Kyiv Oblast.<br></p>

        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-0 display-4">Ukrainian and Russian negotiators met in Istanbul for a new round of in-person talks. Ahead of the meeting Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stated that Ukraine was ready to agree to 4 out of Russia’s 6 demands. He claimed Ukraine was prepared to renounce NATO membership and to make Russian Ukraine's second official language. According to Erdoğan Ukraine was not prepared to recognise the Russian occupation of Crimea or parts of Luhansk and Donetsk Oblasts. Ukraine proposed adopting a neutral status in exchange for security guarantees along the lines of NATO Article 5. The proposals also included a 15-year consultation period on the status of Russian-annexed Crimea and return of all Russian forces to their pre-invasion positions. Russia's Ministry of Defense announced "drastic reduction of military activity" on the Kyiv and Chernihiv fronts, which, Russian presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky clarified, was not tantamount to a ceasefire. The United States Department of Defense cautioned that an observed movement of elements of the Russian army away from Kyiv was likely "a repositioning, not a real withdrawal". In a televised meeting with military bloggers on 13 June 2023 Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that Russia and Ukraine had on this day came to "a good agreement on how to resolve the current situation by peaceful means" but that the Ukrainians had "threw it away" after the withdrawal of Russian troops from Kyiv after the (failed) Russian 2022 offensive on Kyiv. According to Putin Ukraine had agreed to curb Neo-Nazism in Ukraine through the "introducing appropriate restrictions in the law in Ukraine", but this had failed to happen intentionally. On 14 June 2023 President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko claimed, in an interview with Russia-1, that Ukrainian and Russian delegations had discussed the possibility of "some sort of a lease" of Crimea during the March 2022 negotiations.
<br>
<br>Despite the negotiations, airstrikes and ground fighting continued unabated. The Ukrainian military reported they were holding back Russian invasion forces in the east, southeast, and northeast, counterattacking in certain areas. Intense fighting occurred around the suburbs of Kyiv, especially in the northwest and northeast of the capital. A Russian airstrike hit a regional government building in Mykolaiv, killing at least 35 and wounding 33 others.
<br>
<br>Local officials reported a series of explosions outside the Russian city of Belgorod, near the border with Ukraine. According to TASS, a temporary Russian military camp was hit by a shell fired from the Ukrainian side, wounding at least four.<br></p>

On the Kyiv front, the western suburbs of Bucha, Irpin, Hostomel, and Makariv, as well as the route from and to the city of Zhytomyr to the west, and areas north of Vyshhorod remained subject to Russian shelling. Later on 28 March, Mayor Oleksandr Markushyn announced that the city of Irpin had been fully retaken by the Ukrainian forces.
<br>
<br>Heavy fighting continued in Mariupol, where the Ukrainian forces resisted the Russian offensive into the city's centre. Ukrainian officials accused the Russian military of forcibly deporting local civilians, including children, to Russia. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine described the besieged city as turned into "dust" by the Russian military. The mayor of Mariupol, Vadym Boychenko, called for a complete evacuation of the remaining population of the city.

<br>
<br>The Ukrainian army continued its counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region near the Russian border, claiming full control of Mala Rohan and much of Vilkhivka. According to the Ukrainian military, the Russians largely abandoned their advance in the Sumy region, but regrouped and counterattacked at Izium. The pro-Russian forces of the Luhansk People's Republic reported that the Ukrainian military lost 60 men, six tanks, and three armored personnel carriers in the region on 27 March.
<br>
<br>The Chief of the Defence Intelligence of Ukraine, Brigadier General Kyrylo Budanov, stated that Russia's efforts to overthrow the Ukrainian government had failed and that Putin was now trying to split Ukraine per the "Korean scenario". Zelenskyy said in an interview with Russian independent journalists that his government was ready to accept a neutral, non-nuclear status as part of a peace deal with Russia, but that any agreement would require approval in a nationwide referendum.<br></p>

In the north, the ISW called the decision to use heavy artillery in Kharkiv "a dangerous inflection". Additional Russian forces and logistics columns in southern Belarus appeared to be manoeuvring to support a Kyiv assault. An analyst with the Royal United Services Institute stated that the Ukrainian regular army was no longer functioning in formations but in largely fixed defences, and was increasingly integrated with Territorial Defense Forces and armed volunteers.
<br>
<br>A diplomatic crisis in Greece–Russia relations was sparked when Russian air forces bombarded Buhas and Sartana near Mariupol, majority-populated by Ukrainian Greeks, killing 12 Greeks. Greece protested strongly, summoning the Russian ambassador. French President Emmanuel Macron and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, along with Germany and other countries, expressed their condolences to Greece. Russian authorities denied responsibility, but Greek authorities stated that they had evidence of Russian involvement. Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced that his country would send defensive military equipment and humanitarian aid to support Ukraine.

On the morning of 28 February, the UK defence ministry said that most Russian ground forces remained over 30 km (19 mi) north of Kyiv, having been slowed by Ukrainian resistance at Hostomel Airport. It also said that despite fighting near Chernihiv and Kharkiv, both cities remained under Ukrainian control. Maxar Technologies released satellite images showing a Russian column, including tanks and self-propelled artillery, travelling toward Kyiv near Ivankiv. The firm initially stated that the convoy was approximately 27 kilometres (17 mi) long, but clarified later that day that the column was actually more than 64 kilometres (40 mi) in length.

<br>Ukrainian advisor Arestovych stated that more than 200 Russian military vehicles had been destroyed or damaged on the highway between Irpin and Zhytomyr by 14:00 EET. Ihor Terekhov, mayor of Kharkiv, said that nine civilians were killed and 37 wounded by Russian shells. Oksana Markarova, the Ukrainian ambassador to the US, accused Russia of using a vacuum bomb.
<br>
<br>Talks between Ukrainian and Russian representatives in Gomel, Belarus ended without a breakthrough. As a condition for ending the invasion, Putin demanded Ukraine's neutrality, "denazification" and "demilitarisation", and recognition of Crimea as Russian territory.<br></p>

<br>
<br>According to UK military intelligence, Russian mechanised forces bypassed Chernihiv and moved towards Kyiv. Luhansk Oblast governor Serhiy Haidai accused Russian forces of destroying Stanytsia Luhanska and Shchastia before capturing them, while Donetsk Oblast governor Pavlo Kyrylenko also accused them of destroying Volnovakha.
<br>
<br>The ISW said that Russian forces in northern Ukraine had likely begun an "operational pause" the previous day, to deploy additional forces and supplies; Russian military resources not previously part of the invasion force were being moved toward Ukraine in anticipation of a more difficult conflict than initially expected.<br></p>

The phrase Putin used, namely "special mode of combat service", was unknown on the basis of open sources. The order was interpreted as a threat and met with criticism from NATO, the EU, and the United Nations (UN); NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg described it as "dangerous and irresponsible", while UN official Stéphane Dujarric called the idea of a nuclear war "inconceivable".

<br>According to intelligence analyst firm Rochan Consulting, Russia had succeeded in connecting Crimea with areas in eastern Ukraine held by pro-Russian forces by besieging Mariupol and Berdiansk. Oleksiy Arestovych, an advisor to Zelenskyy, said that Berdiansk had been captured by Russian forces. The main Russian force from the Crimea advanced north towards Zaporizhzhia, while a Russian force on the east bank of the Dnipro threatened Mykolaiv.<br></p>

Heavy fighting near the Vasylkiv air base prevented firefighters from tackling the blaze. Also, a group of Ukrainian Roma (Gypsies) reportedly seized a Russian tank in Liubymivka, close to Kakhovka in Kherson Oblast. The Presidential Office stated that Zhuliany Airport was also bombed. Russian-backed separatists in Luhansk province said that an oil terminal in the town of Rovenky was hit by a Ukrainian missile. The State Emergency Service of Ukraine in Kharkiv rescued 80 people from a nine-story residential building hit by Russian artillery, extensively damaging it and killing a woman.
<br>
<br>Nova Kakhovka's mayor, Vladimir Kovalenko, confirmed that the city had been seized by Russian troops, and accused them of destroying the settlements of Kozatske and Vesele. Russian troops also entered Kharkiv, with fighting in the city streets, including in the city centre. At the same time, Russian tanks started pushing into Sumy. The Russian Defense Ministry announced that they had completely surrounded Kherson and Berdiansk, and captured Henichesk and Kherson International Airport in Chornobaivka. Ukrainian forces struck the Russian-occupied airport at Chornobaivka, inflicting losses on the Russian army. By early afternoon, Kharkiv Oblast governor Oleh Synyehubov stated that Ukrainian forces had regained full control of Kharkiv, and Ukrainian authorities said that dozens of Russian troops had surrendered. Hennadiy Matsegora, the mayor of Kupiansk, agreed to hand over control of the city to Russian forces.<br></p>

The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russia had committed its operational northern reserve of 17 battalion tactical groups (BTGs) after Ukrainian forces halted the advance of 14 BTGs north of Kyiv. Russia temporarily abandoned attempts to seize Chernihiv and Kharkiv after attacks were repelled by determined Ukrainian resistance, and bypassed those cities to continue towards Kyiv. In the south, Russia took Berdiansk and threatened to encircle Mariupol.
<br>
<br>The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said that poor planning and execution was leading to morale and logistical issues for the Russian military in northern Ukraine. US and UK officials reported that Russian forces faced shortages of gasoline and diesel fuel, leading to tanks and armoured vehicles stalling and slowing their advance. Videos also emerged online of Russian tanks and armoured personnel carriers (APCs) stranded on the roadside. Russia continued to not use its full arsenal; the ISW said this was likely to avoid the diplomatic and public relations consequences of mass civilian casualties, as well as to avoid creating rubble that would impede the advance of its own forces.<br></p>

        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-0 display-4">Heavy fighting was reported overnight to the south of Kyiv, near Vasylkiv and its air base. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that a Ukrainian Su-27 fighter had shot down a Russian Il-76 transport plane carrying paratroopers near the city. Vasylkiv mayor Natalia Balasinovich said her city was successfully defended by Ukrainian forces and fighting was ending.
<br>
<br>More than 48 explosions in 30 minutes were reported around Kyiv, as the Ukrainian military was reported to be fighting near the CHP-6 power station in the northern neighbourhood of Troieshchyna. BBC News reported that the attack might have been an attempt to cut off electricity to the city. Heavy fighting was reported near the Kyiv Zoo and the Shuliavka neighbourhood. The Ukrainian military said it repelled a Russian attack on an army base on Peremohy Avenue, a main road in Kyiv; it also said it repelled a Russian assault on Mykolaiv on the Black Sea. American officials said a Russian Il-76 transport plane was shot down by Ukrainian forces near Bila Tserkva, about 80 kilometres (50 mi) south of Kyiv. US officials stated that American intelligence data, shared with Ukrainian forces in real-time, helped to down the Il-76. Zelenskyy, remaining in Kyiv, refused US offers of evacuation, instead requesting more ammunition for Ukrainian troops.<br><br>Hundreds of casualties were reported in overnight fighting in Kyiv, where shelling destroyed an apartment building, bridges, and schools. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that its aircraft had conducted 34 sorties in the past 24 hours, indicating that Russia had unexpectedly continued to fail to gain air superiority.<br><br>By afternoon, most of the Russian forces that had amassed around Ukraine were fighting in the country. Mayor Klitschko of Kyiv imposed a curfew from 5 p.m. 26 February until 8 a.m. 28 February, warning that anyone found outside during that time would be considered part of enemy sabotage and reconnaissance groups. Internet connections were disrupted in parts of Ukraine, particularly the south and east. In response to a request from Mykhailo Fedorov, the Vice-Prime Minister of Ukraine, Elon Musk announced that he had turned on his Starlink service in Ukraine, with "more terminals en route".<br></p>

        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-0 display-4">By the evening, the Pentagon stated that Russia had not established air supremacy over Ukrainian airspace, as US analysts had predicted. Ukrainian air defence capabilities had been degraded by Russian attacks, but remained operational. Military aircraft from both nations continued to fly over Ukraine. The Pentagon also said that Russian troops were not advancing as quickly as either US intelligence or Moscow had believed they would, that Russia had not taken any population centres, and that Ukrainian command and control was still intact. The Pentagon warned that Russia had sent into Ukraine only 30 per cent of the 150,000–190,000 troops it had massed at the border.
<br>
<br>Reports circulated of a Ukrainian missile attack against the Millerovo air base in Russia, to prevent the base from being used to provide air support to Russian troops in Ukraine.
<br>
<br>Zelenskyy said that the Ukrainian government was not "afraid to talk about neutral status". On the same day, President Putin indicated to Xi Jinping, the Chinese paramount leader and general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, that "Russia is willing to conduct high-level negotiations with Ukraine".

Russia's Spetsnaz troops infiltrated the city with the intention of "hunting" government officials. An unmarked armored vehicle was filmed veering across a road and crushing a civilian car in northern Kyiv. Although widely captioned as the act of a Russian tank, experts suggested it was unclear who operated the military vehicle or why the incident occurred. The civilian driving the car, an elderly man, survived and was helped out by locals.<br><br>The mayor of Horlivka in the Russian-backed Donetsk People's Republic said that the Ukrainian military had hit a local school building, killing two teachers.
<br>
<br>As Russian troops approached Kyiv, Zelenskyy asked residents to prepare Molotov cocktails to "neutralise" the enemy. Putin meanwhile called on the Ukrainian military to overthrow the government. Ukraine distributed 18,000 guns to Kyiv residents who expressed a willingness to fight and deployed the Territorial Defence Forces, the reserves of the Ukrainian military, to defend Kyiv. The Defence Ministry also announced that all Ukrainian civilians were eligible to volunteer for military service regardless of their age.<br></p>

The Ukrainian government said that it had shot down an enemy aircraft over Kyiv, which crashed into a residential building, setting it on fire. It was later confirmed that the aircraft was a Ukrainian Su-27.
<br>
<br>Independent military analysts noted that Russian forces in the north of the country appeared to be heavily engaged by the Ukrainian military. Russian units attempting to encircle Kyiv and advance into Kharkiv were bogged down in heavy fighting, with social media images suggesting that some Russian armoured columns were ambushed.
<br>
<br>Russian operations in the east and south were more effective. The Russian units outside Donbas appeared to have manoeuvred around the prepared defensive trenches and attacked Ukrainian defensive positions in the rear. Meanwhile, Russian military forces advancing from Crimea divided into two columns, with analysts suggesting that they may have been attempting to encircle and entrap the Ukrainian defenders at Donbas, forcing the Ukrainians to abandon their prepared defences and fight in the open.
<br>
<br>Zelenskyy accused Russia of targeting civilian sites; Ukrainian Interior Ministry representative Vadym Denysenko said that 33 civilian sites had been hit in the previous 24 hours.<br></p>

Seventeen civilians were confirmed killed, including thirteen killed in Southern Ukraine, three in Mariupol, and one in Kharkiv. Zelenskyy said that 137 Ukrainian citizens (both soldiers and civilians) died on the first day of the invasion, whilst claiming that over 1,000 Russian soldiers had also been killed in the same period. He ordered a general mobilisation of all Ukrainian males between 18 and 60 years old, who were also banned from leaving Ukraine.<br></p>

The Center for Naval Analyses said that Russia would create a pincer movement to encircle Kyiv and envelop Ukraine's forces in the east, with the Center for Strategic and International Studies identifying three axes of advance: from Belarus in the north, from Donetsk in the center, and from Crimea in the south. The US said it believed that Russia intended to "decapitate" Ukraine's government and install its own, and US intelligence officials believed that Kyiv would fall within 96 hours.
