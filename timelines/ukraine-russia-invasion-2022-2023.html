        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-0 display-4">Russian launched around 81 missiles, including 6 kinzhal missiles and 8 drones at Ukrainian cities. Ukraine's Military stated it shot down 34 missiles and 4 Shahed drones. Around nine people were killed and blackouts were reported. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant was briefly cut off from the Ukrainian electrical grid, leaving it running on backup diesel generators for the sixth time since Russian forces seized control of it 12 months ago. Russia stated that the attack was response to the 2023 Bryansk Oblast attack.
<br>
<br>The Head of Lithuanian military intelligence Elegijus Paulavicius, said in an interview that Russia had the resources to continue the war in Ukraine for at least two years at the "current intensity". He also dismissed the effect of sanctions as Russia had "long chains of intermediaries" to obtain Western technology.
<br>
<br>Western officials estimated between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian soldiers had been killed or wounded in the fighting around Bakhmut, while Ukrainian forces have lost about one fifth as many. These numbers could not be verified.</p>

Manufacturers needed larger orders to be financially secure enough to build new factories; new orders of artillery ammunition could take 2–3 years if produced using only the current factories.

        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-0 display-4">Ukrainian forces reportedly began their withdrawal from Bakhmut and reports stated that many civilians fled from the city.
<br>
<br>Rheinmetall, a German military vehicle and weapons manufacturing company, is reported to be negotiating with the government of Ukraine about the possibility of building a tank factory in Ukraine. The proposed factory would cost about 200 million euros and be capable of producing up to 400 Panther KF51 tanks per year. Armin Papperger, the CEO, reportedly argues that Ukraine would need about 600 to 800 new tanks to win the war, which is more than the 300 existing tanks that Germany could supply them with.
<br>
<br>The Ukrainian Defence Minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, wrote a letter to the European Union asking for 250,000 155mm shells per month. Ukrainian forces use approximately 110,000 155mm shells per month. He claimed that Ukrainian forces were only firing a fifth of what they could due to shortages. The Ukrainian hope is to use "594,000" shells per month. NATO is considering establishing factories in Eastern Europe to increase production of Soviet era ammunition.</p>

<br>
<br>The United States authorized $2 billion in aid to Ukraine, and ramped up sanctions and tariffs on Russia. The weapons package announced by the Defense Department included funding for contracts for HIMARS rockets, drones and counter-drone equipment, mine-clearing devices, 155-millimeter artillery ammunition and secure lines of communication.
<br>
<br>China proposed a peace plan which involves a ceasefire and multiple other steps that would result in direct negotiations. China holds the stance about "countries' sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity be effectively guaranteed" and that the "cold war mentality" should end.

The Biden administration was reluctant to deploy the system for months, as a Patriot battery complex would need at least 90 trained troops to operate and maintain it, along with concerns that it would provoke Russia to escalate.

The Russian Ministry of Defence stated Ukraine attempted to strike Russia's long-range aviation bombers with Soviet-made jet drones, and that the drones were subsequently shot down at low altitude when approaching the air bases. The attack involved the use of Tu-141 drones that were taken out of storage and appeared to have been fitted with improvised explosives. While no significant damage or burn marks were visible on satellite images of Engels-2, at least one Tu-22M3 bomber was visually confirmed to be slightly damaged at Dyagilevo.
<br>
<br>Following the attacks, Russia launched a renewed wave of missile strikes against Ukraine, consisting of about 70 cruise missiles. Ukraine claimed 60 missiles were shot down, Russia claimed 17 targets were hit on the ground. As a result, a missile fell into the territory of Moldova, near the city of Briceni.</p>

        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-0 display-4">Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, suggested the creation of a UN court to investigate war crimes committed by Russia. Russia does not recognize the International Criminal Court, so the European Commission proposed two possible alternative ways to hold Russia accountable: either to create a court that would be set up by international treaties, or to create an international court with a number of judges from several countries. She estimated the war damage to Ukraine is about 600 billion Euros. She proposed a financial plan to help pay for this. She pointed out that the EU had frozen 300 billion Euros worth of Russian central bank reserves and 20 billion Euros worth of money belonging to Russian oligarchs, which she suggested should be invested. The investments could be given to Ukraine when sanctions are lifted. The original statement by Ursula von der Leyen included a claim that 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers and 20,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed so far in the war. This angered Ukrainian military officials, who said that the death toll was classified information. In response, the European Commission edited the video of von der Leyen's speech to remove this information. Official publications of the text of the speech were also edited to omit the numbers.</p>

<br>
<br>A missile crossed over the Ukrainian-Polish border and struck the village of Przewodów, killing two civilians. Top leaders in Poland held an emergency meeting. Initial assessments by the United States found that the missile was likely to have been an air defence missile fired by Ukrainian forces at an incoming Russian missile.

<br>The Armed Forces of Ukraine retook the village of Kupiansk-Vuzlovyi in Kharkiv Oblast. As of 27 September, up to 6% of the oblast's territory remained under occupation.
<br>
<br>The results of the referendums in the Russian-occupied territories were announced, all of which were in favor of annexation into Russia, with Donetsk Oblast 99.23% in favour, Luhansk Oblast 98.42% in favour, Kherson Oblast 87.05%, and Zaporizhzhia Oblast at 93.11%. There were planned votes in the Mykolaiv and Kharkiv oblasts that never materialized, mainly owing to limited control of territory. As a side effect of these referendums, Russia now claimed that the "very existence of the state is at risk", since much of the war was happening on what it now illegally considered Russian territory, and could be used as justification of using nuclear weapons.
<br>
<br>Over 194,000 Russian citizens, primarily fighting age men and their families, left Russia in what has been called a "mass exodus" after the announcement of a draft of 300,000 citizens to fight in the war. Many have gone to Kazakhstan, Serbia, Georgia, and Finland.</p>

Although Putin's address stated only reservists will be called up, with a focus on reservists with military experience, the official decree allowed for any citizen to be conscripted with exceptions for only age, sickness, and imprisonment status; it was reported that anti-war protesters who had been arrested were being conscripted. Furthermore, militants in the Luhansk and Donetsk People's Republics were to be considered soldiers of the Russian Federation going forward, and the LPR and DPR military units will be reordered according to Russian standards. Defence minister Sergei Shoigu said that 300,000 reservists will be mobilized. Putin also raised the threat of a nuclear response, saying "Russia will use all the instruments at its disposal to counter a threat against its territorial integrity—this is not a bluff".

<br>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Saudi Arabia reported that Russia released ten foreign prisoners of war after mediation by Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

<br>A record 215 Ukrainian soldiers, including fighters who led the defence of the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol, were released in a prisoner exchange with Russia after mediation by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.

<br>After not being used for several months Ukraine resumed its use of Bayraktar TB2 drones. Ukraine started putting footage from these online again after no new footage in the last two months. This was credited to the use of HARM missiles and their impact on Russian air defences.<br></p>

<br>According to the UK MoD, since 29 August Ukrainian forces had gained the element of surprise due to mistakes made by Russian commanders and logistical problems Russian forces face.

<br>Russian support for the war in Ukraine remained stable despite it dragging on for six months. The greatest disagreement was on whether to continue the war or proceed to negotiations.
<br>
<br>Ukraine was searching the UK for foundries to make 155 mm ammunition due to Western stockpiles running low. BAE systems can increase production however Ukrainian officials are looking for other manufacturers. The US had sent "806,000" of these rounds to Ukraine and replacing them could take as long as "18 months".<br></p>
